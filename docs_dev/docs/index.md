## About

The COSCUP Volunteer is hosted by [Secretary Team](secretary_team/overview.md) <small>（行政組）</small>.
This platform allows internal volunteers to join the team they are
interested in, apply for some required forms, integrate with Mattermost and
Telegram accounts and to start accumulating volunteer work.

If you have any questions or ideals, we encourage you to post the suggestions
to the [discussions](https://github.com/COSCUP/COSCUP-Volunteer/discussions) of
the project on Github.

Or mail your thoughts to [volunteer@coscup.org](mailto:volunteer@coscup.org).
