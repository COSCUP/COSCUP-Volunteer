COSCUP is different from other conferences because it is a **community-driven event**, organized by the open-source community. The conference features community tracks, workshops, BoFs, and more. Starting from 2020, COSCUP **no longer requires registration** or ticket purchase to participate. This change also gradually extends the "open-source spirit" from programming to other fields such as "design," "policy," "education," etc., providing a platform for practical sharing in various domains.

Due to this open format, first-time attendees of COSCUP are often overwhelmed by the plethora of session tracks. As an attendee, how should you participate in COSCUP? Here is a simple guide to help you have a unique and enriching experience over the two days of the conference.

## How to Get to COSCUP

Recommended routes to NTUST:

1. **MRT**: Take the Green Line to Gongguan Station, then use a Ubike to ride through the NTU campus to reach NTUST.
2. **Bus**: Get off at the "**NTU Cancer Center (Keelung Rd)**" stop.
3. **Walking**: It's quite tiring, so it's not recommended.
4. **Driving**: The school's parking lot is managed by an external company. Detailed information on parking fees can be found by searching for "**CITY PARKING at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST Station) (CITY PARKING 城市車旅停車場 國立臺灣科技大學停車場(台科大站))**".

COSCUP 2024 will primarily be held in two buildings. In addition to the opening and closing ceremonies, RB will host several related sessions. The TR building's 2nd to 6th floors will be event venues, featuring session tracks, community booths, a massage station, a junior workshop, and the "Fun Fair".

You can move between the two venues by passing through the basketball and tennis courts. If you get lost, please follow the signs along the way or ask a volunteer for assistance.

!!! note "Conference Information"

    - For detailed maps and venue information, please refer to the official website: ["Venue Map"](https://coscup.org/2024/en/venue), which includes information about session rooms, community booths, and more.

## Schedule

COSCUP features open-source topics and sessions hosted by the open-source community. Therefore, at any given time, there are over 20 tracks running simultaneously. It's recommended to spend some time before the event browsing through the conference schedule and noting down the sessions that interest you.

Currently, there are two ways to view the schedule. Please choose the one that suits your reading preference:

1. [Offcial Schedule](https://coscup.org/2024/en/session)：Designed for wide screens. Remember, there are more session tracks on the right side.
2. [Pretalx Submission System](https://pretalx.coscup.org/coscup-2024/schedule/)：Offers various ways to view by "Schedule," "Sessions," or "Speakers." It's slightly more suited for mobile devices, tablets, or those who prefer a listed format.

## BoF

What is a BoF? **Birds of a Feather** is a phrase originating from the proverb "Birds of a feather flock together," meaning "people of similar interests tend to group together." A BoF is an informal discussion meeting format that allows people with similar interests or professional backgrounds to gather during a conference, share experiences, and exchange insights. It enables participants to freely discuss various topics with others who share similar interests, characteristics, or backgrounds.

You can register the BoF activity you want to initiate in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nn5j549QfJ-QhS2RCje91g5Qt9WVsjxxuFBvb51IpI4/). Examples include: "Giveaways Exchange: I have some giveaways from other conferences that I'd like to swap with others!" or "[PGP Key-signing Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party)" (though, is anyone still using PGP these days?).

Every year during the volunteer recruitment for the conference, some enthusiasts are unable to join or fully participate in the preparation process. Therefore, COSCUP has created the "One-Day Volunteer" initiative. This program allows volunteers who are passionate about contributing to the event to still have an opportunity to join us and make a difference during the two-day conference.

In addition to our core preparation team, we offer the "One-Day Volunteer" service mechanism. This is perfect for those who want to gain more insights into how COSCUP organizes its annual conference and provides services to the community and attendees. Roll up your sleeves and join us!

We currently have approximately 60 openings for "One-Day Volunteers." You can review the available positions and see how you can participate. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the administrative team or visit the "Volunteer Service Desk" on the event day for more details.

The Professional Portrait Photography service was first introduced in 2023. The Documentation Team selects a classroom to set up a professional photo studio for taking individual portrait. If you want your profile picture on job sites, personal websites, or social media to reflect your involvement in open source and convey a professional image, you can utilize the "Professional Portrait Photography" service.

Feel free to take advantage of this service to leave a lasting professional impression!

!!! note "Arrive Early"

    - This service is free of charge. Please arrive early to make a reservation or queue on-site. The photo studio is located at `TR-310-1`.

</figure>

The event will be held in the TR building of NTUST. Each floor's bulletin board will feature a dedicated section planned by COSCUP for community use. We encourage you and your communities or companies to make good use of these bulletin boards to [post](https://www.flickr.com/photos/coscup/) information about **personal open-source projects**, **community introductions**, **event announcements**, or **even the annual schedules** of your communities — anything related to open-source promotion.

We hope that attendees and participants will also use the bulletin boards to obtain information about open-source communities. Even if your community doesn't have a dedicated booth at this year's event, the bulletin board is an excellent alternative for promotion.

Based on previous planning, approximately 20 flyers are needed to cover all bulletin boards. If you are interested in posting information, you can also refer to the Open Culture Foundation's flyer promotion methods at FOSDEM earlier this year [here](https://ocf.tw/en/p/global/fosdem-2024/).

!!! info "Flyer Size Recommendations"

    - **A4 Size**: Standard flyer, includes title, content, and QR Code link.
    - **A5 Size**: Half the size of A4, suitable for creating a four-page brochure on a single A4 sheet for project or community introductions.
    - **A6 Size**: One-quarter the size of A4, ideal for event promotion, project promotion, single-use QR Code flyers for surveys, etc.

    It is recommended to design your layout using A4 size. For size adjustments, ask the staff at the copying or printing shop to output the flyers in A5 or A6 size.

## Attendee Survey

Finally, we kindly ask you to complete the [Attendee Survey](https://coscup.org/2024-survey/). This will help us better understand the profile of COSCUP attendees. Since we've moved to an open, registration-free model, conducting this type of survey has become increasingly challenging. Your assistance in completing this survey would be greatly appreciated!
