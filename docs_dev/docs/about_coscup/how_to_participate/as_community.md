# Open Source Community

Your community, in any form related to **open source** and the **spirit of openness**, can be considered a part of the COSCUP open source community. Of course, we are particularly interested in the various ways the spirit of openness is practiced in different fields, whether through individuals or groups!

!!! info ""

    COSCUP was initiated as an event organized by a group of partners from the open-source community. In recent years, efforts have been made to increase the involvement of the open-source community in COSCUP and reduce barriers to participation. This includes organizing the annual grand conference in collaboration with the open-source community.

## Participation Framework

What sets COSCUP apart from other conferences in Taiwan is the format of participation in session planning. Each session track is organized and scheduled by the open-source community itself. The responsibilities of the COSCUP organizing team lie in finalizing the venue and timing and assisting with the dissemination of information.

The types of sessions that the open-source community can organize are not limited to topic sharing alone. They can include workshops, internal community meetings, community policy formulation, and even hosting their own annual conferences within COSCUP. Conducting these events through their own registration and promotion methods is also a viable option.

## Participation of Open Source Communities

COSCUP is a community-driven conference. If you have applied for an "Open Source Track" and a "Community Booth," please refer to the following instructions to ensure you are fully prepared.

### Community Track

If you are organizing a track, please remember to contact your speakers before the event to confirm the schedule and classroom locations. Make sure you have prepared all the necessary equipment for recording the sessions. We recommend printing and posting a schedule of the day's sessions at the entrance of the track classroom to help attendees check the current session information easily as they pass by.

Additionally, you can use the "Community Bulletin Board" to extensively promote your session activities.

### Community Booths

Over the two days of COSCUP, attendees gather to participate. For communities, having a booth at COSCUP to recruit partners, advocate their ideas, and promote regular gatherings is the most efficient way to find like-minded community partners.

The current booth information has been announced. You can refer to the [Community Booth Locations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19ggSO_tz8ozeyH9KwgJD_WAxLcEIL4kN/view) and the [Booth Setup Guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LYh8fVA4ef9h6Mc5sz0EqEYmZIONJgMV/).

Items provided:

- One table (180 x 60 cm), with two chairs. Tables might probably share with other communities if necessary.
- At least ONE 110V AC socket (Total power consumption mustn’t exceed 550W), bring an own power strip if it is needed.

The event will be held in the TR building of NTUST. Each floor's bulletin board will feature a dedicated section planned by COSCUP for community use. We encourage you and your communities or companies to make good use of these bulletin boards to [post](https://www.flickr.com/photos/coscup/) information about **personal open-source projects**, **community introductions**, **event announcements**, or **even the annual schedules** of your communities — anything related to open-source promotion.

We hope that attendees and participants will also use the bulletin boards to obtain information about open-source communities. Even if your community doesn't have a dedicated booth at this year's event, the bulletin board is an excellent alternative for promotion.

Based on previous planning, approximately 20 flyers are needed to cover all bulletin boards. If you are interested in posting information, you can also refer to the Open Culture Foundation's flyer promotion methods at FOSDEM earlier this year [here](https://ocf.tw/en/p/global/fosdem-2024/).

!!! info "Flyer Size Recommendations"

    - **A4 Size**: Standard flyer, includes title, content, and QR Code link.
    - **A5 Size**: Half the size of A4, suitable for creating a four-page brochure on a single A4 sheet for project or community introductions.
    - **A6 Size**: One-quarter the size of A4, ideal for event promotion, project promotion, single-use QR Code flyers for surveys, etc.

    It is recommended to design your layout using A4 size. For size adjustments, ask the staff at the copying or printing shop to output the flyers in A5 or A6 size.

## BoF and Fringes

We also encourage communities to take advantage of the time before and after COSCUP to organize their own community meetings. You can record relevant event information in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nn5j549QfJ-QhS2RCje91g5Qt9WVsjxxuFBvb51IpI4/edit?usp=sharing).

## Assistance

If community partners have any questions, you can seek assistance from [the program team](mailto:program@coscup.org). If you are a member of the open-source community, you can first inquire with the community leader or contact person for help.
