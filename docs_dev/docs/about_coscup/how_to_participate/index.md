## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

??? question "How to register and purchase tickets?"

    - Starting in 2020, COSCUP has decided to open the doors to the event. As long as you remember the time and location, there's no need to purchase tickets or register; you can just participate directly!

??? question "Where is the event located?"

    1. We usually hold the annual COSCUP event at the Yan-Yang Building (TR, `研揚大樓`) of NTUST ([National Taiwan University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntust.edu.tw/)).
        - Location: No. 43, Section 4, Keelung Rd, Da’an District, Taipei City
    2. Since the building is closer to the **NTU Animal Hospital**, we recommend getting off at the "**NTU Cancer Center (Keelung Rd), 臺大癌醫(基隆路)**" bus stop if you are taking a bus.

??? question "What community activities are there before COSCUP?"

    1. [Eve Gathering](../eve_gathering/overview.md): An event where you can come in person, have a drink, talk about open-source, and meet old friends without worrying about attending COSCUP the next day.
