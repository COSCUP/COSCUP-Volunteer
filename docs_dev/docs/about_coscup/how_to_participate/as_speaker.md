# Speakers

How to become a session speaker. After COSCUP announces the community track agenda, you can start preparing to challenge by submitting your proposal. This stage will take some time to research and construct the theme, but one principle to keep in mind is that COSCUP focuses on issues relevant to the open-source field, regardless of their performance or presentation format. Therefore, any ideas and achievements are welcome to be submitted through the call for proposals process by the program committee!

Don't hesitate anymore; taking action leads to opportunities!

!!! tip ""

    The Call for Proposals has been announced. You can refer to [this article](./2024_cfp.md) for introductions to each community track.

## How to Become a Speaker

Once you have decided to participate in the community track and the conference officially announces the selections, you can start preparing the content required for submission.

### Browse the Community Tracks

After the conference announcement, you can quickly browse through the currently selected open-source communities and also take a brief look at the themes for this year's various community tracks.

!!! tip ""

    The community tracks for 2024 have been announced. Please refer to [this article](./2024_cfp.md) for details.

### How to Choose a Topic

Firstly, take stock of any ongoing research projects or projects you are currently interested in but have just begun. At this stage, it's recommended not to set the threshold of "whether it can be submitted," but simply take stock of topics related to open-source projects. This is primarily used to identify potential submission topics.

Next, review whether there have been conferences, meetups, or community events in your field this year or last year. Quickly browse through the selected agenda topics to align yourself with what topics everyone is currently focusing on.

Below are some internationally recognized seminars with diverse agendas for reference:

- FOSDEM：[2024](https://fosdem.org/2024/)、[2023](https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/)。
- FOSSASIA：[2024](https://eventyay.com/e/55d2a466)、[2023](https://eventyay.com/e/7cfe0771)。
- SCaLE：[21x 2024](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/21x)、[20x 2023](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/20x)。
- Open Source Summit：
    - North America：[2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/)、[2023](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2023/open-source-summit-north-america/)。
    - Japan：[2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-japan/)、[2023](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2023/open-source-summit-japan/)。
- AsiaBSDCon：[Taipei 2024](https://2024.asiabsdcon.org/)、[Japan 2023](https://2023.asiabsdcon.org/)。

Lastly, the more challenging part is setting your own theme as a challenge. Sometimes we call this "**conference-driven**" growth. By committing to sharing a topic on stage, you immerse yourself in an interesting topic of research!

### Preparing Your Submission

The first step in the submission process often involves deciding how to set the title. There isn't a standard answer here, but there are some suggestions to consider.

Firstly, consider the length of the title. To avoid formatting issues, it's best to keep it to around 25 Chinese characters, 50 English letters, or when using a mix of both, three English letters count as one Chinese character, with a total text length not exceeding 25 Chinese characters.

The title should ideally express your purpose and solution. When writing the abstract, you can expand on the purpose in the first paragraph. Details of the solution can be elaborated on in the second paragraph. Finally, evaluate what aspects of content this session can bring to the audience - technical insights, process design, comprehensive analysis - allowing the reviewing committee to have more evaluation criteria to decide whether to accept your submission!

### First-Time Speakers

We have an option available for first-time speakers. When your submission is successfully selected, there will be subsequent assistance to help you prepare your slides and practice your presentation. Your assisting partners are experienced speakers who will provide you with relevant feedback and advice, ensuring that you can adjust to the best condition before the event!

!!! tip ""

    The program is named the "First-timer Program." If you have any questions regarding the program, feel free to directly contact the [Program Team](mailto:program@coscup.org) for assistance.

### Community Track Coordinators

As COSCUP's agenda is presented in collaboration with various open-source communities, for any issues related to community tracks, you can first contact the respective track coordinators for assistance. However, if the track is part of the main conference agenda, please reach out to the program committee for assistance.

### Unable to Find a Suitable Track for Submission

If you cannot find a suitable track for submission, it is recommended to prepare your title and abstract and then directly email the program committee to seek assistance in evaluating the appropriate community track for submission. If you have an existing community, you can also invite them to participate in COSCUP next time!

### Presentation Preparation Suggestions

As COSCUP sees increasing participation from international partners, it is suggested to present your slides in English content. Even if you deliver your presentation in Chinese or any other language on-site, presenting in English can lower the participation barrier for international partners. Of course, we also highly encourage setting a personal challenge to present in English. **COSCUP is just a small stage for practice, hoping to provide you with opportunities to speak at international conferences in the future!**
