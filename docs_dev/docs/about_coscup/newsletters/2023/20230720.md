## Recent updates

1. BoF / Hacking Room: The [announcement](https://blog.coscup.org/2023/07/coscup-2023-bof-hacking-room.html?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=advance_notice_230720) has also been made. Please check the content and schedule a time to host a BoF (Birds of a Feather) meetup. (Is there anyone still wanting to host a PGP key signing BoF? Wait, what is PGP? Will there be a souvenir exchange event like last year this year?)

Lightning talk 2.0: It has also been [announced](https://blog.coscup.org/2023/07/coscup-lightning-talk-20.html?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=advance_notice_230720) that the duration has been reduced from 5 minutes in previous years to 3 minutes this year. If there is any mistake on stage, it may disappear immediately... (Sign up first)
3.
