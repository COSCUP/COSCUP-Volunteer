## Submission

This year's community track features over 30+. You can refer to the [Call for Proposals](https://blog.coscup.org/2023/04/coscup-2023-coscup-2023-call-for.html) for an introduction and instructions. Next, you can proceed to the [Submission System](https://pretalx.coscup.org/coscup-2023/locale/set?locale=en&next=/coscup-2023/cfp%3F) to submit your session proposal. Start by submitting the title and abstract, and then gradually complete the rest. If you are not satisfied with the initially set title, adjustments can be made later. Enjoy the process!

### Musing

Here are the three key points to consider when preparing your submission for the COSCUP program:

1. Identify a valuable topic: Choose a topic in which you have expertise and experience within the open-source field, ensuring that it is important and valuable to the open-source community or relevant audience. This will help capture the interest of the reviewers.
2. Provide a concise and compelling abstract: Write a concise and engaging abstract that clearly summarizes your topic, content, and expected outcomes. Make sure the abstract can pique the readers' interest within a short period and motivate them to learn more about your presentation.
3. Showcase your expertise and experience: Present your knowledge and experience in the chosen topic or related areas. This will help establish your credibility and demonstrate to the reviewers that you are capable of delivering a valuable presentation. If you have relevant papers, slides, or blog articles, provide links or attachments to further support your expertise.

By considering these key points, you can prepare a competitive and attention-grabbing submission, increasing your chances of being selected. Best of luck with your submission!
