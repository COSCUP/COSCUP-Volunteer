The COSCUP booth team is going to Singapore for the [FOSSASIA Summit 2023](https://eventyay.com/e/7cfe0771). We have also successfully applied for a booth to promote COSCUP in Singapore! FOSSASIA is also a big event focusing on free and open-source technology. The FOSSASIA event will take place from 4/13 to 4/15. If you would like to participate, you can get a 70% discount through [this link](https://eventyay.com/e/7cfe0771?code=coscup).

Furthermore, we would like to meet up and have dinner with our friends who are working in Singapore. If you or your friends are working in Singapore, please feel free to pass on this dinner invitation. If you have any questions or would like to have dinner and chat with the booth team, you can reply to our dedicated email address: [booth@coscup.org](mailto:booth@coscup.org).
