At this moment, the COSCUP Engagement Team is participating in the booth activities (#232) at [SCaLE21x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/21x) in California. If you suddenly find yourself available and interested in joining, you can use these two discount codes [Ticket Purchase](https://register.socallinuxexpo.org/reg6/): "**7AMGW3ZNNC**" and "**COS50**"!

In addition to producing flyers for distribution on-site, we've also created an [online promotional material](../../../global_engagement/hello_world.md) to balance the amount of information we want to convey. If you find other suitable occasions to introduce COSCUP to more people, feel free to use this page!
