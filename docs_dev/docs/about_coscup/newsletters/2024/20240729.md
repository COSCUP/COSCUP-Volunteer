# COSCUP 2024: The Final Week Before the Event

COSCUP 2024 is entering its final week and will be held this weekend (8/3 and 8/4, at NTUST)! This issue of the newsletter is here to remind you to make sure you're prepared. Is there anything you haven't completed yet? Take advantage of this last week to finish up any remaining tasks!

## How to Participate and Prepare for COSCUP

Every year during the final week, we prepare a "Pre-Event Notification" email for you, providing information about COSCUP's activities. Given that last year's message volume was overwhelming, cramming all the information into an email proved impractical.

This year, we've written a "[How to Participate and Prepare for COSCUP](../../how_to_participate/index.md)" manual. Through your role attributes, you can find the information most relevant to you.

All participants at COSCUP are defined as "[attendees](../../how_to_participate/as_attendee.md)." Depending on your role, whether it be in one or multiple capacities, you can refer to the appropriate guide for: open source communities, speakers, sponsorship partners, and volunteer team members.

We hope this helps you organize your thoughts during the final week and quickly get up to speed for the weekend's activities amidst your busy schedule!

The Eve Gathering has begun selling drink tickets. This year, we offer packages of 3 or 10 tickets for you to choose from, and group purchases are encouraged!

Buying a drink ticket helps us cover venue costs. As per tradition: Whether or not you are attending COSCUP the next day, if you are free on the evening of 8/2, come have a drink and talk open source with us!

For detailed event information and drink ticket purchases, please refer to the [Eve Gathering](../../eve_gathering/overview.md) page.

For information about the series of attendee services, please refer to the [Attendee Services](../../attendee_services/index.md) page. We want to remind you that some services require prior reservation, such as: [Wine Yoga](../../health_market/overview.md), healing painting, peaceful sleep, and the [Junior Workshop](../../junior_workshop/overview.md). These services have a cap on the number of participants, so if your schedule allows, we hope you can fully enjoy these specially planned attendee services.

Continuing with the "healing" topic, we also have a series of [Healing Lectures](../../healing_lectures/overview.md) sessions that you are welcome to attend.

The new initiative "Fun Fair" this year is themed "Open Source Menu." Be sure to check it out if you have some free time! Additionally, some vendors are offering pre-order services — you can place an order now and pick it up on the event day! For more details, please visit the [Fun Fair](../../fun_fair/overview.md) page.

## In Conclusion

Lastly, we want to express our heartfelt gratitude for accompanying us through this final week leading up to the event. We also appreciate all the feedback and suggestions you've given us during the preparation phase. If you see any of the preparation team members at the venue, feel free to continue engaging with us to help us improve!

A heads-up for next year: 2025 marks the 20th anniversary of COSCUP. Although it might seem a bit early to mention, we are already thinking ahead and might need your assistance to make the 20th anniversary even more enriching. Stay tuned for more details on the concept and plans, which will be shared during the opening and closing sessions by the conference preparation team.

Let's make the 20th anniversary milestone an ongoing manifestation of a "**community-driven open source conference**" and the "**spirit of open source**"!
