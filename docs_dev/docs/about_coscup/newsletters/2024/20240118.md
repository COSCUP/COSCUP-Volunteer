The COSCUP 2024 organizing team successfully kicked off last week, and each team has started recruiting volunteers for this year. Join us in preparing for the annual event!

This message will guide you through important information for future participation in COSCUP, whether you are a volunteer, community partner, speaker, sponsor, or attendee!

By the way, all the [session videos](https://www.youtube.com/@coscup) from 2023 have been uploaded to YouTube. If you missed any sessions you wanted to hear, you can watch the video replays!

## Basic Information

COSCUP 2024 is tentatively scheduled for **08/03 - 08/04**, and the venue is at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology.

As the conference is organized collaboratively with the participation of open-source communities, we plan to recruit for the open-source community track starting in February, with the program call for proposals expected to be completed in May.

For relevant information, you can refer to [the announcements](https://blog.coscup.org/2023/05/ways-to-join-coscup-2023.html) from the past COSCUP 2023 to prepare in advance for planning various tasks. Or refer to "[COSCUP unveiled / OSI / Paloma Oliveira](https://blog.opensource.org/coscup-unveiled/)".

## Volunteering

Currently, each team has updated recruitment information on [Volunteer Services](https://volunteer.coscup.org/). If you are interested in participating in the preparation process, please carefully read the selection qualifications and procedures for each team.

The conference will continue to have a [One-Day Volunteer](https://volunteer.coscup.org/tasks/2023) activity where participants can become volunteer partners for the two-day event (or pre-party). If you are unable to fully participate in the preparation process, you can still look forward to participating through the [One-Day Volunteer](https://volunteer.coscup.org/tasks/2023) option!
