# COSCUP Recent Updates: Agenda Announcement, Eve Gathering, Attendee Services

COSCUP 2024 is just two weeks away! The volunteers team is working hard to arrange and schedule this year's activities. This newsletter provides a quick update on the confirmed items so far. It's about time to start preparing and planning your participation in COSCUP!

## Community Agenda Announcement

COSCUP is an annual conference organized with the participation of the open-source community. After receiving submissions and reviewing them from various sources, the community agenda tracks have finally selected submissions that fit the community themes. This year, around 500 submissions were received from about 400 contributors, with approximately 330 selected for presentation, covering a total of 41 tracks.

Whether or not you'll be attending COSCUP the next day, if you're free on Friday night, come join us for a drink and chat about open source!

Additionally, this year the volunteers team has specially reminded various open source communities to plan "after-parties" following the "Eve Gathering." On the day of the event, be sure to ask the communities, "Where are we heading for the after-party?"

In the past five years, COSCUP has gradually developed activities aimed at attendee participation, hoping that during the two-day event, attendees can experience activities focused on relaxation and well-being, in addition to the main conference agenda.

This year, we have combined the "[Healing Market](../../health_market/overview.md)" (massage station, wine yoga, healing painting, healing sleep), "[Healing Lectures](../../healing_lectures/overview.md)" (lectures on trauma recovery, understanding emotional and social interactions), "[Junior Workshops](../../junior_workshop/overview.md)" (welding, making video games with children), and the "[Fun Fair](../../fun_fair/overview.md)" (practicing the open source spirit and open source recipes) into what we call "**Attendee Services**."

Due to the limited space in the newsletter, a detailed description of these activities cannot be provided here. Please refer to the "Attendee Services" introduction page. Some activities require reservations, and we warmly welcome you to schedule time to participate or experience these activities!

Additionally, on the day of the event, you can also take advantage of the "Profile Photo" service provided by the Documentation Team and the [BoF, Hacking Room](https://blog.coscup.org/2024/06/coscup-2024-bof-hacking-room.html) arranged by the Agenda Team.

This is a new initiative for 2024, and we expect to recruit 4-6 booths to join us in practicing the "open source spirit." Currently, about 40% of the booth reservations have been made, so there are still available spots — you're welcome to join us!

As this is our first year trying this out, we are not charging booth fees. For detailed booth recruitment information, please refer to the description.

## Final Note

We have less than 15 days left until COSCUP 2024! Are you feeling a little nervous? How are your preparations going? This time, in what role will you participate in this year's event? As a speaker sharing your session, a community booth manager promoting your booth, or an attendee upgrading your open-source energy regularly? No matter what role you're participating in, remember that getting to know new community partners is also an important part of attending COSCUP.

Since there's quite a bit of content in this issue, we will continue with more updates next week. If you think COSCUP is a great annual conference, please help us spread the word to more people or encourage them to [subscribe to the newsletter (or read online)](../overview.md) to stay updated with us!
