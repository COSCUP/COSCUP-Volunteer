COSCUP Attendee Services offers services beyond the main conference agenda, aimed at participants. In addition to the two-day main event, attendees can enjoy more fun, special, and relaxed activities over the weekend and during weekdays.

The COSCUP 2024 secretary team has organized the current planned activities and given them a more appropriate name: "Attendee Services." We hope that this year and in the future, we will have clearer goals to continue planning activities for attendees and participants.

The confirmed activities for 2024 are as follows. You can read the detailed activity descriptions one by one, and note that some activities require reservations to participate!

    We will find a bar in Taipei City and invite everyone to come and chat about open source, and have a drink, whether or not you plan to attend COSCUP in the coming days! :laughing: [Go to :fontawesome-solid-share:](../eve_gathering/overview.md)

    How to implement the "open source spirit" in real life? We are asking booths to present their products, processes, or recipes in the form of an "open source menu" and share their results with attendees who visit their booths. :ferris_wheel: [Go to :fontawesome-solid-share:](../fun_fair/overview.md)

-   :gift_heart: [【Healing Lectures】](../healing_lectures/overview.md)

    Compared to complex technologies or obscure industry jargon, the healing seminars focus more on exploring the real everyday issues people face related to technology, humanities, society, and open organizations. Discussions cover topics such as love, harm, understanding, and trauma recovery. :heart_hands: [Go to :fontawesome-solid-share:](../healing_lectures/overview.md)

-   :playground_slide: [【Junior Workshops】](../junior_workshop/overview.md)
