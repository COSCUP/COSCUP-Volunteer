Urban life is fast-paced with high work pressure, and on weekends, we always want activities that help us relieve stress and recharge ourselves, allowing us to face tomorrow's challenges in a better state.

And when it comes to the latest trendy and fashionable choice, we can't ignore the popular "Yoga Wine" from Europe and America.

Now you can experience this body-mind-spirit wellness exercise at COSCUP.

During the course, the instructor will guide participants to taste different stages of wine while practicing various yoga poses, experiencing the wine's flavors and savoring its layers and nuances. The alcohol also increases blood circulation, generating body heat and achieving muscle warm-up, similar to the effects of hot yoga.

### What is Yoga Wine?

Born in New York in 2017, Yoga Wine is a course that incorporates red wine into yoga practice. During the yoga session, participants each hold a glass of red wine. The instructor leads the participants in yoga poses and incorporates cup movements to increase the difficulty and intensity. For example, holding a wine glass while performing Warrior III in yoga requires more muscular endurance compared to traditional yoga without props, as it prevents the liquid from spilling. This can lead to greater fat burning and exercise benefits.

### Course Information

1. Each session lasts for one hour, `NTD$500` per people, with up to 12 participants.
2. This class includes approximately 45 minutes of wine yoga practice and around 15 minutes of explanation. Wine glasses will be provided. In case of any damage to the wine glasses, we kindly charge a **NTD$280** fee per wine glass.
3. Bring to class: Yoga mat, bottle of water, small towel.
