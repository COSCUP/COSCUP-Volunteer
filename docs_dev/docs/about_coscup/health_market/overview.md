Do you have shoulder and neck pain? If you have accumulated fatigue from daily life, you can relax and rest at the Massage Station. There will be four massage therapists available on-site to assist you. Just come and get a massage whenever you need it!

### Station Guidelines

1. Massage is provided in a seated position.
2. Try not to exceed 30 minutes at a time. It's not advisable to have a massage for too long!
3. After the massage, it is recommended to drink warm water. There are water dispensers at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, so it is recommended to bring a water bottle.
