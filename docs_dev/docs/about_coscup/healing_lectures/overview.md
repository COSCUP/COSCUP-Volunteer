# :heart_exclamation: Healing Lectures - Tech-Human Dialogue in Open Culture: Love, Harm, Understanding, Repair

==:heartbeat: The Healing Market series of activities== {++:green_apple: Hosted by Secretary Team++}

Unlike the complex technical jargon or obscure industry terminology, the Healing Seminar focuses more on exploring issues related to technology, humanities, society, and open organizations in our day-to-day life. It aims to promote understanding of how technology influences our values, emotions, and social interactions. Through these discussions, we hope to explore how to achieve harmonious coexistence between technology and the humanities in this turbulent era, as well as how to address various challenges brought about by technological development.

This year's agenda mainly focuses on discussions of topics such as love, harm, understanding, and repair, with a particular emphasis on themes related to love, trauma, justice, and civic dialogue.

When individuals embrace justice and ideals in their hearts, they can break free from the unjust societal shackles of the past and truly empower themselves to take action. This is the future we envision, and we are curious about the process.

    The Healing Lectures is part of the COSCUP Healing Market series of activities, aiming to provide attendees with the opportunity to focus on softer topics while participating in COSCUP. The [Healing Market](../health_market/overview.md) offers physical relaxation activities such as massage stations, mindfulness meditation, wine yoga, therapeutic painting, and peaceful sleep. **The Healing Lectures extends this concept, with a focus this year in 2024 on trauma and recovery between workplace and open-source communities, promoting comfortable coexistence of diverse cultures.** This session is organized by the COSCUP Secretary Team.
