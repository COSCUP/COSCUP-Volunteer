### Documents / Cloud Drive / HackMD

During the event, various documents and records will be created and shared using [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AOZjvdnZrYhQUk9PVA). [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/team/coscup) may also be used to record certain meeting minutes.

!!! note "Data Storage"

    Google Drive has folders for past years' data, available for historical viewing and retrieval, but please note that personal or sensitive information should be handled separately.

    ??? info "Task tracking"

        - Currently, there is no unified requirement for using a specific tool for task tracking or management system in the conference. Each team can decide on their own.
        - Some teams are known to use Trello, Github Project for task assignment.

## Meeting

The conference usually holds synchronous meetings every two weeks one month before the event, and changes to weekly meetings when there is one month left until the event.

Each team meeting is determined by the team leader. If there are cross-team tasks, relevant personnel can be convened for discussion. If there are difficult decisions to make, the overall coordinators can be requested to attend.

!!! info "Having it would be better"

    - Please remember to take **meeting minutes** or document meeting conclusions for the sake of future reference and **continuity**.
    - Consider creating **public meetings** and using the [conference schedule](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_a376ec8beb6ef0ab3acb5fe3213880dfcbba50ce89107532aacbfdda71c6e294%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Asia%2FTaipe) to provide online meetings this year.
    - If there is a need to establish a meeting with more than 3 people and last for more than 1 hour, you can seek the assistance of the Secretary team to set up the meeting.
