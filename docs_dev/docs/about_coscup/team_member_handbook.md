# Team Member Handbook

Thank you for participating in this preparation event. Here is a 'Team Member Handbook' provided to guide you during the event.

## Code of Conduct (CoC)

Please follow by the [Code of Conduct](https://volunteer.coscup.org/coc) to create a good environment for event preparation. Please also follow the community guidelines of other conference and community.

If there is any violation of the community guidelines, please report it to the [CoC Team](mailto:coc@coscup.org).

## How to ask questions

For matters related to volunteers, please ask to Secretary Team. For operational issues within each team, please first communicate and discuss with the team leader. If the issue cannot be resolved or there is ambiguity, please propose a temporary motion for discussion during the conference meeting.

When asking a question, please clarify the core issue. If possible, **please include one or two proposed solutions** for consideration, which can help team leaders or task members make decisions quickly.

???+ tip "Habits of discussing matters"

    - Partners are humble, teams are joyful, and work is passionate. Please maintain this atmosphere.
    - Although it is passionate, it is also professional. Before speaking, it is best to do your homework and speak with evidence.
    - Although it is joyful, please moderate the amount of water and pay attention to the quality of the water.
    - Although it is humble, there is no need to belittle oneself to the level of elementary school with bad grammar or spelling.
    - The team likes positive suggestions and execution, and dislikes negative criticisms. If you find that something has not been done well, please be sure to raise it immediately in the channel. If you can suggest a better way of improvement, that is even better. However, it must be about the matter, not the person, and do not blame others.
    - Encourage partners to discuss matters privately. After a decision is made, especially if other teams need to cooperate, it must be publicly announced in the channel to leave a record, so that everyone remembers the same thing. The decision made within the team should also be sent to the channel or team mailbox for reference.
