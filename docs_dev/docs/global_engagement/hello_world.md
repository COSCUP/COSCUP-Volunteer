## What’s COSCUP

COSCUP is the Conference for Open Source Coders, Users & Promoters. It is organized by a group of Taiwan open-source communities together and usually takes place at the end of July or early August every year. Around 2000 - 3000 attendees participate in COSCUP each year.

This year it will take place on 2024/08/03 - 2024/08/04.

## Call for Participation

We are now calling for participation for open source community booths/stands, open source tracks, and speakers. For further details, please refer to the information page.

## Call for Volunteers

We are very welcome to invite you to join our volunteers. To be honest we may not be fully prepared for volunteers from foreign countries, but we are enthusiastic about improving the environment for all. Further details will be announced soon.

## Seeking Assistance

### Program Participation

We warmly welcome you to propose a topic for us or to share your experiences with open-source projects, whether you're from the community or working on an open-source project. Currently, we are particularly interested in topics related to establishing open-source projects, team experiences, and collaborating with open-source contributors from around the world!

### International Engagement

In 2023, COSCUP attempted our first venture into international conferences and booth promotions. After our initial experience collaborating with partners from other regions, we realized that many issues we face are not unique to us alone.

We have decided to continue seeking opportunities to participate on the international stage. Therefore, we welcome you, your organization, your open-source community, or any group associated with us to engage in ongoing projects / plans, maintain contact, and share valuable experiences in open-source contributions and the spirit of open source.

### Stay Updated with Us

There are two ways to stay updated with us: subscribe to our newsletter to stay informed about any upcoming events and not miss out on important moments.

Alternatively, you can directly contact our engagement team. If you have any questions or ideas for collaboration, whether it's regarding the program, volunteering, sponsorship, or any other matters, please feel free to email us to discuss further.
