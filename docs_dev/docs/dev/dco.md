# Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

We enforce the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)** on Pull Requests.
It requires all commit messages include the `Signed-off-by` with an email addres
that matches the commit author and the name on your Github account.

    How to sign-off your commit, please read the [How to sign-off commits](how-to-signoff.md).

The DCO is for contributors to certify that you wrote or otherwise have
the right to submit the code you are contributing to the project.

Here are the full texts of DCO, reformatted for readability.
The [original version](https://developercertificate.org/) can be found here.

    By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
        have the right to submit it under the open source license
        indicated in the file; or

    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
        of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
        license and I have the right under that license to submit that
        work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
        by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
        permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
        in the file; or

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
        person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
        it.

    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
        are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
        personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
        maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
        this project or the open source license(s) involved.
